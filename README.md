# multibot
Run muliple Discord bots with same code in one window.

## Setup
Install node.js v14.xx, preferably LTS. Then in npm, download discord.js module and then paste tokens in 'tokens.txt', each token being newline separated, and then run! If you have prior experience in JS, i guess you can edit 'bot.js' to your liking. 

## Running
You'll need terminal window and set directory to be same as where the script, then run `./start.sh`
 If it doesn't work, give `start.sh` execution permission like `chmod +x start.sh`
